# VFCP-Calculator

This is an Excel VBA Project which was created to complete calculations for the IRS Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program.
Retirement plan Fiduciaries routinely fail to invest clients' funds into the correct sources by the required dates.
The IRS created the VFCP to allow fiduciaries to independently assess the damages owed to clients for lost earnings on these funds.
The IRS has provided a tool on their website to calculate the damages, but the tool requires that each account be enterred manually, one at a time.

The firm I worked for required a settlement to be calculated in which several thousand participants were involved. The manual data entry would've taken far too long.

Thus, I was asked to create this project which perfectly follows the rules of the VFCP but also allows an indeterminant amount of participants to be enterred at once.
